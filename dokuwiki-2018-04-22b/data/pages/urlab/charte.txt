The main value of the hackerspace is respect : everything comes from it and nothing can be done without it:

  * thou shalt respect the space because the hackerspace could not exist without it, therefore it should be maintained in the best state possible;
  * thou shalt respect others because the hackerspace is only a structure, without others it's only a dead shell; we are a community;
  * thou shalt respect other's differences because the hackerspace is open to everyone and the more diversity we have, the more creative we are;
  * thou shalt respect newfags because everyone is a newfag to someone else;
  * thou shalt respect one's opinions even if it differs from yours; respect their constructive comments and reconsider your state of mind; no progress could be made if we all had the same opinions;
  * thou shalt respect others by reflecting on what you say; a comment should always be thought through before being spoken;
  * thou shalt respect the right to make errors because no one is perfect and everyone is here to learn;
  * thou shalt respect the materials and projects because without them, the hackerspace loses it's purpose.
